# HR Analytics ‚Äì Attendance Data Insights Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes real (masked) employee attendance data from the 2022‚Äì2023 period to support the HR department with data-driven insights. The goal is to extract information that helps understand employee working preferences and sick leave patterns.

## üîç Problem Statement
Raw attendance data across months is difficult to interpret and use for decision-making. HR needed clear insights into employee behavior, specifically:
- Working preferences (office vs. remote)
- Sick leave percentages

## üìä Data Description
The dataset consists of real but anonymized attendance data stored in an Excel file. Each sheet represents a monthly report with daily attendance types (e.g., Present, WFH, Sick) and aggregated totals. An additional sheet provides a key to interpret codes used across the file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Methods
- **Excel**: Raw data source
- **Power BI**: Data modeling and visualization
- **Power Query**: Data transformation and preparation

### üßπ Data Preparation Summary
Basic cleaning and reshaping were performed in Power Query to convert the raw Excel structure into a tabular format suitable for analysis.

## üìà Key Insights
- **Working Preferences**: Identified trends in office vs. remote work.
- **Sick Leave %**: Measured overall sick leave rate to support HR wellness monitoring.

## üìå Outcome
The Power BI dashboard enables HR decision-makers to:
- Visualize employee attendance behavior
- Adapt policies for hybrid work models
- Monitor sick leave usage

## üìÅ Files Included
- `Attendance Sheet 2022-2023_Masked.xlsx`: Original data source (not included in repo)
- Power BI `.pbix` file: Final interactive dashboard (not included in repo for privacy)
